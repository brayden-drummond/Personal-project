    about:
      'As the Leviathan forms a connection with the Pyramid, Nightmares of the past awaken and threaten to torment any who dare intervene. Stare into the abyss and find bravery within the mantle of the reaper and the steel of the scythe.',
    activities:
      'Nightmare Containment is this seasons primary activity. It takes place in the Castellum on the Derelict Leviathan and is a Public Event. There are three tiers that take you around the Castellum to fight enemies and bind Shards of Dread — a fancy, in-game way of saying “kill enemies to progress the event.” Each tier has different tasks you need to complete, so keep an eye on the left side of your screen to see the games instructions. Sever is the weekly mission that takes you through the underbelly of the Leviathan and has some fun puzzles to solve. You can use a Bound Presence to open an extra chest of seasonal loot at the end of the mission.',
